# Residual Energy-Based Models for Text Generation

This repo implements the Residual Energy-Based Model as described in [Residual Energy-Based Models for Text Generation](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=B1l4SgHKDH). Note that both data and model (generator+discriminator) are different from the original paper: the goal is just to show how the pipeline works, using much less computational resources.

The training and evaluation scripts can be found in [REBM.ipynb](REBM.ipynb).
